INSERT INTO `tbl_help_faq` VALUES (1,' What is No More Cards?','No More Cards is a new breed of mobile application. It\'s designed to interact with the No More Cards servers and merchant platform to provide an all-in-one solution for a consumer\'s mobile commerce needs. It allows a consumer to pay safely and securely for their goods and services at participating merchants without having to carry their actual credit or payment cards. Additionally, No More Cards allows consumers to look for and receive special offers and promotions directly from merchants, all from within the same mobile application.'),(2,' Isn\'t No More Cards the same as all the other mobile wallets I have heard about?','While there are many versions of mobile wallets available, they are definitely not created equal. In fact just because an application says it is a â€œMobile Walletâ€ does not necessarily mean it will do what you expect. The term â€œMobile Walletâ€ has been used to describe any application dealing with credit cards or personal information, regardless of it\'s actual function. As a result you can have one program that only stores numbers and personal information like a safe for personal reference, another one that allows you to make payments with a single special prepaid account only, while others will store multiple credit card numbers and allow you to pay for things with them. All of them have fallen under the term â€œMobile Walletâ€. That is why we actual consider ourselves a â€œMobile Commerceâ€ application. No More Cards allows you to do what you need to do, shop and buy, the way you want to do it. No More Cards is not limited to only one type of account and in fact consumers will be able to load and safely store all of their payment accounts into the application for later use, including Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Store Cards, Gift Cards, even 3rd party payment accounts like PayPal. It also does more than just making payments. No More Cards actually helps you find the deals you want and then even helps you buy them, regardless if it\'s in a store, online, or in our remote mobile environment. All within an easy to use, all-in-one application.'),(3,' Do I have to do anything special or have a certain phone to use No More Cards?','Unlike other mobile applications, No More Cards does not require consumers to upgrade their existing smartphone to some special built-in hardware or add-on accessory. While No More Cards was designed to be future conscious and ready for new and upcoming technology, it was designed to be universal now. No More Cards is launching with Android and iOS versions, with Windows and Blackberry to follow shortly. No More Cards even has a non-smartphone version to be available soon in select markets. As long as there is a camera and GPS, and our application is installed, your phone can work with our platform.\n'),(4,' I\'m always worried about giving my information out. How safe is No More Cards?','No More Cards is just as concerned as you are about the security of your account details. In fact, that one issue was what caused No More Cards to be created in the first place. When you go into a store, do you hand your wallet over to the sales clerk for them to take out whatever cash they need for the purchase? Of course not, but every time you hand a clerk or server your credit card that is essentially exactly what you are doing. It\'s an established fact that the majority of credit card and identity theft happens directly at the transactions level. Whenever you pay for something you are handing your personal financial information, either online or in an actual location, to someone and hoping blindly that they can be trusted and are honest. We knew that there had to be a better, safer way. With No More Cards, the merchant provides you their information and you choose how to pay and submit the transaction for approval yourself through our application. The merchant receives the approval same as they always did only, with us at no time does anyone actually see your account information so there is nothing for them to steal. Even if a store owner wanted to, it\'s impossible for someone to create fraudulent charges within No More Cards, because the consumer handles the transaction, not the merchant.\n'),(5,'How easy is it to use No More Cards?','No More Cards was designed to be as easy to use as possible while still providing all the features and functions consumers wanted most in an application. When you want to purchase something using No More Cards, simply open the application and log-in, scan the code the merchant shows you for the transaction, choose an account to buy with and confirm everything is right, and done. It\'s really that simple.'),(6,'Can I use No More Cards anywhere, or is it only for stores or websites?','No More Cards was designed for consumers to use everywhere. Anywhere you see our â€œPay With NMCâ€ code besides online or in a store; in a print ad, on TV, on a social media site like Facebook, or even on a store\'s flyer, you can purchase safely, securely, and quickly with all the convenience and features No More Cards offers.\n'),(7,'What does â€œOffersâ€ mean?','Offers are promotions and rewards that Companies develop to encourage and earn a consumer\'s trust and business. They can be in the form of anything from a traditional coupon to special offers to even a special discount rewards club for subscribed consumers. No More Cards integrated a complete promotional system into it\'s application, allowing consumers the ability to find what they want, when they want it, and at the best price available. As consumers move around throughout their day, they can tell No More Cards that they want something special for lunch, and No More Cards will seek out participating restaurants as close as possible to them and let them know what options are available. No more hunting around and hoping to find something good, No More Cards brings the specials to you. Maybe a consumer needs a new appliance or wardrobe, No More Cards can find that for them too. Once a consumer selects what kind of promotions or offers they want to know about, they just go about their day and No More Cards does the rest automatically. Whenever the consumer gets close to a participating merchant who is offering what they are looking for, No More Cards let\'s them know.'),(8,'What does â€œDirect Purchase Itemsâ€ mean?','No More Cards knows that today a consumer\'s schedule can be very hectic. Sometimes so much so that even having the time to go to a store or shop online is a luxury not often available. One of the key features of No More Cards is that consumers are able to purchase what we call Direct Purchase Items from directly within our mobile application. Merchants that are subscribed to No More Cards can choose to enter details for a particular product or service into their No More Cards account. Once entered, they can use the special designed code for each item  to display the item on anything from flyers and signs to even online videos or commercials. When a consumer sees and scans the code with the No More Cards application, the app displays all the information and details for that item. The consumer is able to make their choices from the available options, even for shipping, and actually purchase the item immediately. As a result, any place that merchants can use to display one of our remote product codes can be used now to allow the consumer to make their purchases. As an additional benefit, No More Cards has the ability to let the consumer search at any time directly through the Shopping Assistant to find items, or even entire catalogs, that they can purchase from within the mobile application. All without the inconvenience of having to adjust their busy schedule to make time to go shopping.  '),(9,'I don\'t like getting junk mail or spam for stuff I don\'t want. How does No More Cards keep this from happening?','No More Cards has several settings a consumer can use to customize what offers and promotions they receive. Consumers can browse through a listing of categories and sub-categories, selecting only the types they want to receive notices on. They can even select specific stores or brands to be focused on. At any time a consumer can do a general search through our Shopping Assistant which will pull any offers regardless of the stored preferences, but only the chosen types will actually be regularly pushed to the No More Cards application. This way the consumer can have their regular offers they normally buy, but also have a way to find that special item or service that is only needed once in a while. The offers consumers receive are based on their stored addresses and the offer\'s or business\' distance to those addresses. Because the received offers are not based on GPS data, the offers are considered to be more appropriate as most purchasing is done nearby familiar or regularly traveled addresses such as a home or work location.\n'),(10,'Having all sorts of apps running on my phone causes my battery to die quick. Especially ones that use GPS. If I use No More Cards, how does it affect my battery life?','No More Cards only uses GPS for Shopping Assistant searches when the consumer selects to view results that are near their current location. Any coupon, offer, promotion, remote product, or business near the consumer and meeting the consumer\'s search criteria will appear in the results. Otherwise results can be displayed based against the the consumer\'s stored addresses to show consumers results most appropriate for purchasing, (for example, places near their home or work which are specific addresses and do not need continuous GPS positioning to find nearby offers or businesses). When someone does use Shopping Assistant searches using GPS positioning, there is an option to even have the application continuously search until the consumer tells it to stop looking. This way the consumer can have the application continue to look repeatedly while they run their errands and find offers and businesses throughout their travel route.\n'),(11,'What happens if I lose my phone? Do I lose all my information?','Unlike some other mobile applications, No More Cards does not store any personal financial information on the mobile device or within the mobile application. All data is maintained securely within the No More Cards servers for easy retrieval once a new phone is ready. Additionally, as an extra safeguard, logging into the consumer web portal allows the consumer to actual wipe the No More Cards application data from the phone to prevent any attempts to use the application fraudulently. If a consumer doesn\'t have access to a computer, they can also call our customer service to have it done for them. After wiping No More Cards access from the old phone, and the consumer has a new phone, they simply download the app and sign in with their initial login and all their old data is available on the new phone. No re-entering of credit card info, no calling to cancel credit cards and waiting for replacements, no risking someone using your personal information to commit identity theft.\n'),(12,'What happens if I switch phones? Do I have to sign up again on the new phone?','Just as when a consumer loses their cell phone, all the consumer has to do is wipe the application data from the old phone either through the consumer web portal or by calling customer service, download the No More Cards application, install it, and sign in with their initial login. All data is automatically ready for use on the new phone. No re-entering data or creating new accounts is required.');
