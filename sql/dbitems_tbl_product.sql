Each panel is constructed of a different canvas material, similar to the variety of bags one would see when passing by local vendors at a street market. The tongue contains a small, zippered compartment that is big enough to store a folded, reusable shopping bag - or anything worth keeping in a small bag. Following the market theme, the tongue label resembles the nutrition labels found on food packaging.

While there tends to be Air Jordan 1 colorways released every year, in 2013 Jordan Brand went back to the original formula for Jordan 1s. They introduced the \"OG\" versions of the Jordan 1, which featured \"Nike Air\" labeling on the tongue and on the insoles as well. Jordan collectors often place a higher value on these tiny details because when the original Nike Air Jordan released in 1985, the Jumpman logo hadn’t even been created, which means the retro AJ1s with the Jumpman on the tongue, heel or insole, are just not quite the same. Surprisingly, the Bred Jordan 1 OG didn’t release until the end of 2013, which meant two things. There were a lot of other Jordan Retro 1 High OG colorways that had already come out and the holiday release meant there would also be a Jordan 11 releasing near the same time. That didn’t seem to make an ounce of difference with sneaker enthusiasts and Jordan fans. The 2013 Air Jordan Retro High OG Bred sold out in what seemed like seconds and even the restocks that followed were scooped up quickly, making this Black/Varsity Red colorway more than worth its weight in leather.',0,' 555088-023','2022-03-31 16:46:53','2022-04-12 13:17:51',NULL,'',0,'','Air Jordan',NULL,NULL,2904,34002,41001,41001,42001,0.00,0,5,0,0,0,NULL,0,NULL,14.80,81004,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,82001,89005,' we are unable to offer returns, exchanges or swaps - including if you ordered the wrong size.

Jordan Brand revived another colorway from the 2001 Jordan 1 CO.JP Pack with the Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy. The original Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy first released as a Japanese exclusive in 2001. With only 3,000 pairs produced, the 2001 Navy CO.JP is one of the rarest Jordan 1 releases of all time. Now, for the first time in almost two decades, the Midnight Navy CO.JP made a return.\r\n\r\nDressed in white tumbled leather, navy suede overlays, and a silver Swoosh, the Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy holds many of the same attributes as the OG. The only point of difference between this 2020 iteration and the OG is that the 2020 pair features classic Nike branding on the tongue instead of the traditional Jump man embroidery. A sail midsole, navy outsole, and bubble Wings logo on the ankle complete the throwback design.\r\n\r\nThe Jordan 1 CO.JP Midnight Navy released in November of 2020.\r\n\r\n',0,'','2022-04-01 04:13:46','2022-06-09 14:57:51',NULL,'',0,'','Air Jordan',NULL,NULL,2904,34002,41001,41001,42001,0.00,0,5,0,0,0,NULL,0,NULL,14.80,81004,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,1,82001,89005,'we are unable to offer returns, exchanges or swaps - including if you ordered the wrong size.
