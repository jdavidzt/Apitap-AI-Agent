INSERT INTO `tbl_help_guide` VALUES (1,'Registration','In order to use NMC services you must enter your login data and get it validated by NMC systems. If  you have not previously registered then this will need to be done first. What follows are some guidelines to on how the registration process functions within the NMC application.\\n'),(2,'Scan & Purchase','2.1 General Description:\\n\\nScan and Purchase is the core module of our NMC App. With this functionality you will be able to scan a QR/Barcode, enter the code manually or get the item information by using NFC capture and complete the whole purchase using your phone through the NMC app.\\nThe purchase method could be for any of the following types: In-Store Purchase, Online Purchase, Remote Purchase-Flyer, Remote Purchase-Search and Shopping Cart Purchase.\\n\\n2.2 What is a QR Code?\\n\\nQR code stands for Quick Response code. It is a two dimension bar code which is identified by a unique image and number. The QR code will be used to identify an Item or catalog or service or invoice amount within the NMC system. The QR code can then be used as a step to completing a purchase.\\n The QR code can be read in magazines, TVs, newspapers, invoices, advertisements etc. via the camera on the mobile device. Once the system has identified the item, the app will show the information related to the QR code so that you can make a purchase through yourmobile device.\\n\\n2.3 How to use a QR Code with NMC\\n\\nEvery item and catalog that is added to the system, has a unique QR code, so each time you scan a QR code that is attached to an item registered in our system, the NMC app will display the main page of the item or catalog that it is related to.\\n\\n2.4 How can I scan a QR Code to purchase an item with NMC ?\\n\\nScan & Purchase (Step by Step)\\na) Open the NMC app on your phone/device.\\nb) Press the \'Scan and Purchase\' button that can be found on the home page or in  the \'Main Menu\' button.\\nc) The camera on your phone/device will be automatically activated at this point, you just have to point the lens of the camera at the QR Code that belongs to the item and the app will recognize it, if it doesnÂ´t work for any reason then you can also enter the code found next to the QR code manually or use the NFC function if you have an android to get the same result.\\nd) When the app has recognized the QR code, the \'Item details\' screen is displayed in your phone and you will be able to set the preferences (Delivery Options and Delivery Address) for the item that you are about to purchase.\\ne) After you have selected the preferences related to the order, the transaction information including the price is displayed in the app and you can decide if you want to continue with the payment process or if you would prefer to add the item to the cart and purchase it later so that you can continue shopping and possibly add more items to the cart.\\nf) If you have selected to continue with the payment process, you will need to register your prefered payment methods (credit card information, paypal, bank card, etc) or if you have already done it during the registration process you will just need to select one of the payment methods. You will also have the option to spread the payment between more than one payment method.\\ng) The last step is just to confirm your payment authorizing the transaction by signing electronically.\\nh) A confirmation of the purchase will be sent to your phone, and you will be able to see it anytime you wish within the \'history\' section on your app.\\n\\n2.5 Delivery Options\\n\\nYou can choose if you want to get the item delivered to one of your registered locations e.g. your place of work or whether you want to pick the item up in the merchant\'s store.\\n\\n2.6 Delivery Address\\n\\nThis is the address where you will receive your purchased items, it can be your home address, office address or any other address you want.\\nThis address needs to be set before carrying out the transaction either when you complete the \'Add new account\' function or you can do it through the section \'settings\' at any time.\\n\\n2.7 NFC Operation (For Android)\\n\\nNFC stands for near field communication system. It is a communication that exists between devices that can send and return data by moving a NFC enabled device close or touching another NFC device or chip. This is used for all kinds of transactions including sharing photos, contacts, information etc. \\nIn the NMC mobile application if you have an android you will be able to use your NFC option to share the information from an NFC tag to a mobile device that has the application, so that you can make payments.\\nThese NFC tags are only for in-store Purchases. The NFC tags can actually be in an item (In which case when the user enables NFC and reads the tag the system will show the item information) or the POS can have the NFC function, which will allow the Merchant to send the consumer the Invoice information through the NFC system.\\n\\n2.8 How to use NFC to get the information of an item instead of using the QR Code?\\n\\nYou can use the NFC functionality in case the QR code scanning isnÂ´t working. You will need to activate it first in the settings of your phone so that it is ready to use when you want to use the purchase sections of the NMC app.'),(3,'Add a Payment Method','You must add a valid payment method in order to make a payment. With NMC you will have the option to do your payment through one payment method (Credit Cards,  Paypal, Bank cards, Gift cards, etc...) or you can split your payment.\\n1.
